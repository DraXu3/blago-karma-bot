# Karma bot BLAGO üôèüèª

## Description

BLAGO üôèüèª is a Telegram bot which manages people's karma. Karma is essentially just a number of points assigned to a user. It could be either increased or decreased for whatever reason.
Thus, the bot acts as an arbitrator within a group of people providing ability for such groups to manage their own ecosystem of karma. Which overall leads to an ultimate BLAGO üôèüèª

## Bot commands

* `/help` - displays all available commands with their description
* `/up [reason]` - request +1 KS (Karma score) for a member (an optional reason could be set)
* `/down [reason]` - request -1 KS for a member (an optional reason could be set)
* `/show [user_mention]` - show a list of all memebers with their KS (or only for mentioned member)

```
npm install -g serverless serverless-dotenv-plugin
